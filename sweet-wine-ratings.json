        "notes":"Scarce in quantity the 2011 Reserve Cabernet delivers plenty of complex aromas and lots of classic character. Sourced from a small collection of hillside and benchland vineyards in Calistoga, Oak Knoll and Rutherford, the wine centers around ripe currant and blue-black fruits threaded with tobacco leaf, nutmeg, baking spices and sweet toasty oak. Elegant and supple at first sip the wine gains focus, finishing with fine structure."

        "rating":93.0,
        "notes":"There is distinct power and complexity to our 2016 Reserve Cabernet. Navy blue-black yet brilliant in color the wine is front-loaded with ripe fruit of crushed currants and berries. Secondary notes bring mineral and earth aromas laced with sweet anise and oak spice. Packed with fruit on entry, a dusky, sinewy character develops on the palate with fine-grained tannins tailing to the finish."

        "rating":96.0,
        "notes":"The headline reads: \"2012 Reserve Cabernet - Return of the Big Block\". Running on high octane aromas and built on an iron block with deep reserves of black fruit this 100% Cabernet blend delivers 700 horsepower at the wheels. Coming off idle the nose slowly explodes with sappy dark and rustic berries, clove, cedar and sweet oak spices. Forged, ripe fruit pistons pump out the power for miles until finally finishing with an impressive band of ported and polished tannins. Motor must be warmed-up before driving!"

        "notes":"Neil Young's \"Cinnamon Girl\" best captures the character of our rocking 2015 Reserve Chardonnay. Ripe yet succulent D'Anjou pear, gardenia blossom, sweet mineral spice and toasty brioche aromas come singing through. Broad-shouldered, with creamy textured leesy flavors, the wine reaches great depth while maintaining precision and serious structure."

A plethora of heady aromas alight from the glass with Anjou pear, warm brioche, sweet mineral spice and gardenia blossom. Lush yet lively with great depth and gauzy texture the wine shows impeccable build quality and attention to detail with a miles long finish."

        "variety":"White Wine",
        "rating":91.0,
        "notes":"Our Sonoma Chardonnay comes from some of the oldest Dutton Ranch plantings in Russian River. These vines consistently yield fruit of great complexity and intensity seldom found in other sites. Cooler temperatures toward the end of the 2008 growing season resulted in crisp, well-defined flavors and long ripening times. Ripe citrus, Tupelo honey and sweet floral notes combined with seductive oak and all-spice aromas are just the beginning. Sun-ripened citrus fruit flavors are framed with brilliant acidity giving this wine its trademark zest and tremendous length."

        "notes":"Now 7 years old, Alec's younger brother Ethan shows sunny pride in his new Ethan's Syrah, Lewis' first bottling since the 2001 vintage. And like the sunflowers and lavender in France this wine displays true Rhone character. From cooler-climate vines this 100% Syrah blend is infused with smoky fruit, white pepper and wild floral notes. Sweet shadings of violet and bacon frame a pure focused palate, gathering weight and richness in a plush and persistent finish."

        "notes":"Born in 2000, everything about Ethan and his new 2014 Syrah sings \"sweet sixteen.\" Vivid color and distinctly ripe, youthful Rhone character shines bright with violets, charcuterie, oak and vanilla spices. Sweet blue fruit and silky tannins with a dash of bacon fat create a round, deliciously fresh palate like steam-polished stones. "

        "notes":"Positioned between brothers, Alec and Mason, Ethan gets a walk-off home run in his first at-bat since the 2005 vintage. At short-stop Ethan sees lots of action and his wine covers all the bases with black raspberry, yellow peach and pancetta, plus a field of lavender, licorice and violets. Like a seasoned glove the wine has a supple pocket of boysenberry fruit generously laced with sweet oak and vanilla spice. He keeps his eye on the ball and the wine stays focused though a vibrant, youthful finish, making the out on every play."
